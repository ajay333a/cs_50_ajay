Based on the average energy, danceability, lodness, speechiness, valence and tempo I would consider the perons aura to be "Purple" or "Yellow"
because of variability of the parameters of the songs, which vary highly from song to song but average is at the middle of the scales with which the
parameters are calculated.

My calculations may not be true because of the events in the life of person like attending a party may prompt users to play songs with high
danceability and based on the mood the user may also choose the songs which may differ from day to day.
