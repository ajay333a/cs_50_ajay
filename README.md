### Course Overview
CS50 is an introductory course that covers fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. The course is designed to provide a solid foundation for students, whether they are beginners or have some prior programming experience. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, software engineering, web development, and more.

### Week 0: Scratch
In Week 0, students will get introduced to the world of programming using Scratch, a visual programming language. They will create simple animations and games to understand basic programming concepts such as loops, conditions, and events.

### Week 1: C
Week 1 focuses on the C programming language, covering topics such as variables, data types, loops, conditions, and functions. Students will gain hands-on experience in C programming and start building a strong foundation for more complex topics.

### Week 2: Arrays
This week delves into arrays and their use in programming. Students will learn how to manipulate arrays and apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. The emphasis is on algorithmic problem-solving and efficiency.

### Week 3: Algorithms
Week 3 explores various algorithms and their efficiency. Students will analyze and implement sorting algorithms and search algorithms. This week is crucial for understanding the importance of algorithmic thinking in computer science.

### Week 4: Memory
Understanding how computers manage memory is essential for writing efficient programs. Week 4 covers dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and memory management in the C language.

### Week 5: Data Structures
This week introduces fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues. Students will explore how to use these structures to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

### Week 6: Python
Transitioning to Python, Week 6 covers the basics of the language and emphasizes its ease of use and readability. Students will apply their programming skills to solve problems using Python.

### Week 7: SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the focus of Week 7. Students will learn how to interact with databases, write SQL queries, and understand the principles of database design.

### Week 8: Web Development
Week 8 introduces web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students will create interactive web pages and understand the basics of client-server architecture.

### Week 9: Flask
Building on the web development foundation, Week 9 introduces Flask, a web framework for Python. Students will create dynamic web applications and understand the principles of web routing and templating.
